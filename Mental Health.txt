Mental Health 

Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.


Explore the `students` data using PostgreSQL to find out if you would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.

Here is a data description of the columns you may find helpful.

| `japanese_cate` | Japanese language proficiency                    |
| `english_cate`  | English language proficiency                     |
| `academic`      | Current academic level (undergraduate or graduate) |
| `age`           | Current age of student                           |
| `stay`          | Current length of stay in years                  |
| `todep`         | Total score of depression (PHQ-9 test)           |
| `tosc`          | Total score of social connectedness (SCS test)   |

The Social Connectedness Scale (tosc): is a 20-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure an individual's sense of belonging and connectedness to others in their social environment.

The score of acculturative stress(toas): can be assessed using various scales designed to measure the challenges faced during the adaptation process to a new culture.

The total score of depression (PHQ-9) test: The PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) is a widely used screening tool for assessing the severity of depression and monitoring treatment progress.

The score of acculturative stress (ASISS) test: The SAFE scale measures Acculturative Stress, which is defined as the psychological distress resulting from the challenges of adapting to a new host culture while attempting to maintain one’s heritage culture.

MY Correct Query: 
SELECT 	   stay,
	   COUNT(*) AS count_int, 
	   ROUND(AVG(todep), 2) AS average_phq,
	   ROUND(AVG(tosc), 2) AS average_scs,
	   ROUND(AVG(toas), 2) AS average_as
FROM students
WHERE (inter_dom = 'Inter') AND (stay IS NOT NULL)
GROUP BY stay
ORDER BY stay DESC;
